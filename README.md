## Credits

Big shoutout to [srfrnk](https://github.com/srfrnk) for creating the original repo called [moneo](https://github.com/srfrnk/moneo).
After some digging through the code, I missed some functionality and saw that the old HTTP driver for Neo4J was used.
I decided to rewrite the code with extra functionality and use the [new Neo4J driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver).
So Mongo4J was created. Moneo has provided me with the basic info to get started on this so this could be seen as `version 2.0`.
